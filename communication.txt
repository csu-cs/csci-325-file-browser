Please decide how to communicate (team members can edit this file.)

Some Suggestions:

Twitter: Setup a twitter account that any team member can post to.  This allows everyone to communicate at their leisure and provide a full history of what has been said.

IM/Hangouts/IRC: Share everyone's hangout/IM/IRC account so people can communicate in real time.

email: share everyone's email account to send message back and forth.

You may setup physical meetings, but keep in mind that the online user(s) will need to have a virtual presence!

Team choice (edit below this line):

Adam Wells: 
First, my email is alwells408@gmail.com --
That's the best way to get in contact with me other than my phone number. My best options are Skype, or some type of Voice Chat IRC. Twitter would work I guess, i'm open to any other options. I am a commuting student and am only on campus or in Charleston every Tuesday and  Thursday for class and I can't stay past 11:20 on any day due to work.

Matthew "Tyler" Weekley:
Open to any form of communication. Email is tweekley5@comcast.net. Online student. Play baseball here so my schedule is very limited at times, but I can usually work something out if given around a days notice or so.
